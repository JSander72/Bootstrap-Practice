intro to bootstrap:
Bootstrap is a framework ( a package of items that has component & layouts for CSS ) it allows consistancy through differe broswers

LAYOUTS & GRID SYSTEM
Containers:
continer-fluid (takes up the full width of the screen) just "container" is just placed in the screen

Rows:
when you define a row - whatever col you define for that row will stay in that row

Columns:
colume is broken down into 12 columes - i can determine how many columns i want to take up - so if two should be 6&6 if 3 it would be 4,4,&4 - all amounts should equal up to 12 or you could break to the next line (when the line breaks) your page * if the amount is less then 12 as the screen size changes the row will never break into another row unless i tell it to
